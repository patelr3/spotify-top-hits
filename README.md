# spotify-top-hits
This repository works with a Kaggle [spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019).

## Datasets
The [`dataset`](./dataset) folder contains two datasets. The `songs_normalize.csv` is the original dataset from Kaggle. The `songs_updated.csv` is the dataset after going through updates as described in [`data_cleaning.ipynb`](./data_cleaning/data_cleaning.ipynb). The updated dataset has extra columns to facilitate visualization and modeling.
